# How to contribute
If you like to contribute your work to fgruc, feel free to do so :)
You can select an issue you want to work on or open your own.
Just make sure to not work on an issue if someone already works on it.

## Code Requirements
There are real requirements for your code, however your code should follow these rules:
* Have performance in mind when coding and make sure you use the fastest way possible to perform your task. f in fgruc stands for fast!
* Document and explain your code. This means not only telling people what it does, but also explaining the stuff you tried to implement. Like add a description for a Vector and explain it.
* Some common math methods are already implemented by fgruc, so make sure to not duplicate work and use these.
