# fgruc - A fast graphics rendering utility collection
A lightweight and performant collection of utilities to assist in graphics stuff and game (engine) development.\
\
**CAUTION: Right now fgruc is experimental and lacks most features other math crates provide!**

### What fgruc provides:
* ❌ Vector structs with implementations of various functions for transformations in global or object-local context.
* ❌ Quaternion and Euler Angle structs with implementation of functions to define and transform them.
* ❌ A space struct to define a "world" where Vectors and Angles may exist.
* ❌ Vertex and other structs specifically for 3d graphics rendering.
* ❌ Physics module for interacting with gravity and checking the collision state of objects.
* ❌ Shapes, like cubes and circles, for providing a convenient way to make up objects in a 2d/3d space.
* ❌ Some utils for math stuff and general number... well... number stuff I guess.
