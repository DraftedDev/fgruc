# fgruc - A fast graphics rendering utility collection
A lightweight and performant collection of utilities to assist in graphics stuff and game (engine) development.\
\
**CAUTION: Right now fgruc is experimental and lacks most features other math crates provide!**

***

### What fgruc provides:
* Vector and Matrix struct with full implementations of most functions and operations.
* Universal Color and Vertex struct with full implementations of most functions and operations.
* Optimized sin(), cos(), tan(), etc. functions and other math utils.
* Common enums and types for operations in 2d/3d space.
* Quaternion and Euler structs for rotations and transformations.

### What fgruc does not (and will not) provide:
* High level APIs for Vulkan, OpenGL, etc.
* Utils for operations on the GPU.
* Structs and utils crates like `wgpu` and `ash` provide.

**[What is planned for fgruc to provide in the future](ROADMAP.md)**
